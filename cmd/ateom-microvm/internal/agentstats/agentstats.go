// Package agentstats turns the kata guest agent's per-container cgroup
// accounting into the resource-usage sample ateom reports.
//
// The micro-VM ateom uses it to answer ateompb.Ateom/GetWorkloadStats. The host
// cgroup is the wrong place to look on this runtime: the guest's RAM is a fixed
// allocation cloud-hypervisor takes at boot, so the host cgroup reads roughly
// the same whether the actor is idle or saturated. The numbers that move with
// the workload are the ones the guest kernel keeps, and the agent is what can
// read them.
//
// This package is deliberately pure — it converts an already-fetched
// agentpb.CgroupStats and never talks to a guest — which keeps it testable
// without a live micro-VM and, unlike the rest of the micro-VM ateom, without
// the linux build tag.

// Sample is a point-in-time reading for one container, or the sum of several.
// It carries the same four numbers as the gVisor ateom's cgroupstats.Sample,
// because both feed the same four fields of GetWorkloadStatsResponse.
//
// Anything the guest did not report reads as zero rather than failing the whole
// sample, for the same reason as there: a partial reading is more useful than
// none. FromCgroupStats says which fields can do that and why.

	// the guest kernel does not expose one: the agent fills it from the cgroup's
	// max-usage file, which cgroup v2 only grew in Linux 5.19.
	//
	// For a single container this is exact; summed across containers it is an
	// upper bound, not an observed maximum — see Plus for why.
	MemoryPeakBytes uint64

	// MemoryWorkingSetBytes is MemoryCurrentBytes less the reclaimable page
	// cache, floored at zero — the figure to compare against a memory limit,
	// since MemoryCurrentBytes drifts upward with cache the kernel would drop
	// for free under pressure.
	MemoryWorkingSetBytes uint64

	// MemoryAnonBytes is the container's anonymous memory: what it allocated
	// that no file backs, and that therefore cannot be reclaimed by dropping
	// it. Zero when the guest's memory.stat names it something anonKeys does
	// not know.
	//
	// Not reported on the wire, and not one of the four fields above. It exists
	// for the guest-wide breakdown in internal/guestmem, which needs a
	// per-container figure that does NOT overlap the guest's global page cache.
	// MemoryWorkingSetBytes cannot be that figure: it only removes the INACTIVE
	// file pages, so a container's active file pages remain in it while also
	// being counted in the guest's Cached, and a breakdown built on it would add
	// up to more memory than the guest has.

// Keys of the memory.stat entry holding reclaimable file-backed pages. The

// hierarchical total_inactive_file, and the total is the one that matches what
// v2's figure means.

// total the actor never actually reached. The bound is the honest
// approximation, and for the single-container actors this runtime mostly serves
// it is exact.
//
// The guest kernel does track the true figure: every container cgroup sits
// under the shared /ateomchv parent (see StartOverlayWorkload and the
// CgroupsPath defaults in internal/kata), so with hierarchical accounting the
// parent's memory.peak is the actor-level maximum this sum approximates. The
// kata-agent just has no RPC that reads a cgroup by path — StatsContainer is
// per-container only. If the agent ever grows a sandbox-level stats read, that
// replaces this summing outright.

// Saturating on overflow, so a nonsensical reading from one container cannot
// wrap the total to a small number and read as healthy.
