// Package guestmem answers "where did the micro-VM's guest RAM actually go".
//
// GetWorkloadStats reports the workload's containers, which is the right answer
// to "how much is this actor using" and no answer at all to "why is a 2048 MiB
// guest full". The containers are one slice of the guest; the guest kernel, the
// kata-agent, the page cache charged to no container, and whatever is still
// free are the rest, and none of them appear in a per-container cgroup read.
//
// The missing slices come from the kata-agent's own Prometheus registry
// (grpc.AgentService/GetMetrics), which carries the guest's /proc/meminfo. This
// package parses that scrape and subtracts the pieces down to a residual, so
// the result adds up to the guest's own MemTotal by construction — see
// Breakdown.
//
// Deliberately pure, like agentstats: it converts an already-fetched scrape and
// never talks to a guest, so it is testable without a live micro-VM and needs
// no linux build tag.

	// The flip side is that this slice under-reports what a container "costs" —
	// its kernel memory, and any tmpfs it wrote, are real and land in
	// KernelAndOther instead. For "who is using the guest's RAM" that is the

	// case worth seeing. A healthy guest sits at a modest positive value; a
